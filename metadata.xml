    <description>Works well with my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503994006]Philosopher's Stone[/url] mod which lets you turn trinkets into golden trinkets!

Mom's Box and Golden Trinket's trinket modifying abilities are a really cool mechanic in the game, however they don't work with almost HALF of the trinkets in the game. There are over 80 trinkets that have no effect at all with Mom's Box, and having the Golden version does nothing either. That's where my mod comes in

Trinket Stacking + adds new trinket stacking effects to 22 trinkets that previously lacked them. I designed these effects to be more powerful with the more trinket multiplier you have, so having Mom's Box + the Gold version of a trinket will be even more powerful!
